The CCJ Top 250 is the most comprehensive ranking of active carriers.,None,article_00127.pre.xmi:004,[],,,
Our ranking takes into account not only the revenues posted by a trucking company but also its fleet size and employment base.,None,article_00127.pre.xmi:005,[],,,
Rankings based strictly on revenues often capture activities that have only an indirect relationship to transportation.,None,article_00127.pre.xmi:006,[],,,
"Blending revenue, equipment and drivers also allows for a reasonable way to capture carriers that decline to disclose revenue.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:007,[],,,
"The CCJ Top 250 ranking treats all carriers under one umbrella as a single entity; carriers with significant ownership by an individual, family or company but not organized under a single management team are treated separately.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:008,[],,,
"For a detailed explanation of the CCJ Top 250 ranking methodology, see ""Ranking Methodology"" to the right.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:009,[],,,

"And as we did last year, this year's print version of the CCJ Top 250 information provides only very basic information on the carriers we rank.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:013,[],,,
"Virtually all of the underlying data – revenues, power units and drivers, for example – appear only online at www.ccjtop250.com.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:014,[],,,
The CCJ Top 250 begins with data provided by Randall- Reilly's RigDig Business Intelligence (www.rigdig.com/bi) based on data supplied by carriers to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration on their required Form MCS-150 filings.,None,article_00127.pre.xmi:015,[],,,
"Because this data can be – although rarely is – as much as a couple of years old and because the MCS-150 does not include information on revenues, all carriers included in the ranking were given an opportunity to review FMCSA data for freshness and to supply information not included on the form.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:016,[],,,
"In some cases, CCJ supplements its data with other official sources, such as reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:017,[],,,
"If a carrier declines to verify or update the data that we provide it for review, we presume the publicly available data is valid and use it for ranking purposes.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:018,[],,,
Carriers are never allowed to opt out of the ranking.,None,article_00127.pre.xmi:019,[],,,
Ranking methodology,None,article_00127.pre.xmi:020,[],,,
"CCJ's ranking of companies is a blended scale based on a combination of revenue, total power units and number of drivers rather than a ranking simply by revenue.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:021,[],,,
"Companies considered for inclusion in the CCJ Top 250 were ranked from high to low by revenue, power units (weighted based on the type of power unit as discussed below) and drivers and assigned a rank in each category.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:022,[],,,
The numerical rank stored in each of the three fields was added together (revenue rank + vehicle rank + driver rank) to provide a rank sum.,None,article_00127.pre.xmi:023,[],,,
"This sum then was ordered to provide the overall ranking assigned to each carrier, with the lowest sum receiving the highest rank.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:024,[],,,
A number of carriers failed to report actual 2013 revenue.,None,article_00127.pre.xmi:025,[],,,
"In order to be included in the blended ranking, they were assigned – for blended ranking purposes only – a calculated revenue figure determined by multiplying the carrier's total number of power units by the average of the bottom 50 percent of revenue per power unit performers for the companies in that carrier's primary segment.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:026,[],,,
Calculated revenue is discounted by using the average of the bottom 50 percent of performers so that carriers failing to report revenue are not given an undue advantage in the ranking.,None,article_00127.pre.xmi:027,[],,,
"Calculated revenue almost always will differ from actual revenue, of course, but the effect on the blended ranking likely is slight.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:028,[],,,
"The power unit ranking, which represents an investment as much as a physical-count measure of trucking assets, takes into account the difference between tractors and trucks.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:029,[],,,
"The assumption is that a for-hire carrier with 1,000 tractors has a greater investment in equipment than one with 1,000 straight trucks.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:030,[],,,
"For the purpose of the blended rank only, a truck was weighted at half the value of a tractor.",None,article_00127.pre.xmi:031,[],,,

What you need to know about applying Fall Fertilizer,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:002,[],,,
To fall fertilize or to not fall fertilize – that is the question many growers in Western Canada are asking themselves these days as temperatures gradually begin to drop.,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:003,[],,,
"Even as fertilizer products and application technologies continue to evolve, the primary reason to consider fall fertilization remains the same: it helps to spread out a grower's workload more evenly throughout the year and can substantially reduce the stress they feel come springtime.",None,article_00777.pre.xmi:004,[],,,
"By applying fertilizer in the fall, growers will have more space in their tank for seed and other product in the spring, meaning they have the ability to go longer between fill-ups and wrap up seeding that much quicker.",None,article_00777.pre.xmi:005,[],,,
Another logistical benefit of fall fertilizing is that once you've applied the product to your field you no longer have to worry about subsequent industry shortages or plant failures that could result in costly interruptions to spring seeding.,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:006,[],,,
It can also result in a cost savings as fertilizer prices tend to be lower in fall than in spring.,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:007,[],,,
An additional advantage of fall fertilizing is that soil is typically drier than in the spring.,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:008,[],,,
"As a result, fertilizer applicators are much less likely to get stuck in any ruts created by moist soil conditions.",None,article_00777.pre.xmi:009,[],,,
Drier fall conditions also mean it is easier to incorporate fertilizer rather than simply forcing it to sit on top.,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:010,[],,,
Risks with Fall Fertilizer Applications,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:011,[],,,
"Of course, that's not to say that fall fertilizing doesn't come with some risks.",None,article_00777.pre.xmi:012,[],,,
"Because the product can be on the field for as long as six or seven months before it is used by the plant, that means there is more potential for something to go wrong such as leaching or denitrification.",None,article_00777.pre.xmi:013,[],,,
These two loss mechanisms have been identified as the main reasons why some growers have gone away from fall fertilization.,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:014,[],,,
"You can also lose some of the product to wind and other environmental conditions, although those losses are considered acceptable by most standards.",None,article_00777.pre.xmi:015,[],,,
So what should growers be aware of it they choose to do fall fertilizing?,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:016,[],,,
Timing is everything,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:017,[],,,
You need to wait until soil has sufficiently cooled before applying any kind of fertilizer in the fall.,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:018,[],,,
If you apply it when the soil is still too warm you run the risk of the nitrogen you are apply converting into other forms and are more likely to see leaching or denitrification.,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:019,[],,,
A simple rule of thumb is to wait until soil temperatures are consistently around the 5 C mark or lower.,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:020,[],,,
Soil test before you fertilize,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:021,[],,,
It's also important to consider soil testing prior to applying any post-harvest fertilizer.,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:022,[],,,
"By testing prior to fertilizing, growers will have a much clearer indication about soil levels and what they need to apply to ensure they are putting the right nutrient in the right place at the right time.",None,article_00777.pre.xmi:023,[],,,
Choose the right fertilizer product,None,article_00777.pre.xmi:024,[],,,

Investfit™ is powerful and unique because it uses your client's individual circumstances together with its simulation and optimisation engines to identify the best investment strategy that maximises their financial outcomes.,None,article_00778.pre.xmi:003,[],,,
"That is, the investment strategy expected to achieve the highest retirement goals with a high level of certainty.",None,article_00778.pre.xmi:004,[],,,
Investfit™ uses the latest and most sophisticated financial technology.,None,article_00778.pre.xmi:005,[],,,
"Traditional financial advice, based on spreadsheets that use expected average investment returns have about a 50% chance of being correct.",None,article_00778.pre.xmi:006,[],,,
In other words there is a 50% chance that our retirement income will be less than the figure shown in the advice.,None,article_00778.pre.xmi:007,[],,,
"Investfit™, on the other hand, allows for the fact that investment returns vary from one year to the next and that it is not unusual to have a sequence of poor returns over a number of years, particularly for shares.",None,article_00778.pre.xmi:008,[],,,
"Investfit™ projects these variations in investment returns and also takes into account the correlations between interest rates, inflation, property prices and share prices — that is, the tendency for them to move together or in opposite directions.",None,article_00778.pre.xmi:009,[],,,
"Investfit™ also models a huge number of possible strategies, rather than just the one that has been selected by default or based on a subjective ""risk"" questionnaire.",None,article_00778.pre.xmi:010,[],,,
"By doing this, Investfit™ is able to allow your client to choose the level of certainty needed when planning for the client's financial future and then to find the investment strategy that maximises your client's goals within the chosen level of certainty.",None,article_00778.pre.xmi:011,[],,,
You can also change goals as the program reveals what is possible for your client's retirement.,None,article_00778.pre.xmi:012,[],,,
"For example, you might find that a client can have 90% certainty of a retirement income of $80,000 per year so long as they don't plan to leave an inheritance.",None,article_00778.pre.xmi:013,[],,,
"But suppose they want to leave an inheritance of $200,000, is that possible?",None,article_00778.pre.xmi:014,[],,,
"Well, Investfit™ will answer that and how to do it.",None,article_00778.pre.xmi:015,[],,,
"It might mean the client accepts a lower retirement income, say $75,000, or retiring two years later, or making additional savings.",None,article_00778.pre.xmi:016,[],,,
As the adviser you can change these levers and see the outcomes in real time during your face to face meeting.,None,article_00778.pre.xmi:017,[],,,
